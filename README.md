# Traffic_Signal_Optimization
Traffic Signal Timings Optimization Based on Genetic Algorithm and Gradient Descent
Requirements:
1) Simulation of Urban Mobility
2) Python 3 and some modules
  -traci
  -joblib
  -Distributed evolutionary algorithms in python (DEAP)
  -numpy
  
In order to run the project:
1) Run run.sh, this will use the map.osm file to generate test.net.xml. Then the xml file will be used by
   randomTrips.py to create the car routes. Change the -p flag to alter the number of cars generated
2) Run GA-GD approach or GA approach to run the optimization
